description: Diagnose throughput, latency, memory, utilization, dataloader, and communication bottlenecks after a MindSpore or torch_npu workload already runs

# Performance Agent

Direct specialist entry for performance bottlenecks in workloads that already
run successfully but are too slow, memory-heavy, or poorly utilized across
MindSpore and torch_npu.

For most users, prefer:

- `/diagnose <problem>` to auto-route into `performance-agent` in diagnose mode
- `/fix <problem>` to auto-route into `performance-agent` in fix mode

Use `/performance-agent` only when you already know the problem is a
performance case and want to force the specialist directly.

Load the `performance-agent` skill and follow its workflow in either:

- `diagnose` mode for evidence, root cause, and report only
- `fix` mode for diagnose, fix proposal, confirmation, apply, and verify

## Typical Inputs

- runtime context and symptom description
- profiler trace data if available
- throughput, latency, memory, utilization, or communication symptoms
- earlier readiness snapshot if available
